## Summary

Groups are absolutely central to everything that goes on in the C2C system, making
them the broadest abstraction in the system.  Schools, teams, rosters, and many, many,
other entities exist as extensions of groups and are called "[Group Types](/projects/c2cschools/terms/group-type.html)".
