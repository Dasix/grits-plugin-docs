# Overview

## What are "Premium Packages"?

For years C2C has sold its product as an "all or nothing" system for schools
and sanctioning bodies.  Sanctioning bodies would engage into a contract with
C2C and its member schools would be granted access to all of C2C's school and
team feature sets.

"Premium Packages" represent a change to the status quo.  Instead,
C2C will only provide a subset of its total features to the member schools of
each sanctioning body and schools will need to pay for any features that are
not included in that subset if they would like to have access to them.

## Why make the change?

Sanctioning bodies have their own agendas, desires, and expectations about
what software C2C should deliver to it and its member schools.  While their
intentions are pure and generally try to serve the schools, their still remains
a conflict of interest between their priorities and those of the schools.

The contracts we have with sanctioning bodies are fixed and outline the precise
deliverables and services that C2C must provide.  However, our services to the
schools are not fixed; they vary over time and adapt to the changing needs of
each school.

Because of this, C2C often has to make improvements to its software that go
far beyond what it has been obligated to deliver within the contracts that we 
have with the sanctioning bodies.  Because these features exist outside of the
contracts, we cannot use them to petition for increases in the contract rates.

In other words, sanctioning bodies are only willing to pay for features that they,
themselves, have requested and included in their contracts.  If we respond to
a request from a school, unless our response is mandated by a contract, then
the work effort we put forth is (for all practical purposes) completely 
_unfunded_.

Simply put, a large number of the features and services that we provide do not
have a funding source and, thus, C2C is doing an enormous amount of work for
free.  This is not sustainable and has resulted in a consistent net loss for
the company, which can no longer be tolerated if the company hopes to survive
and flourish.

## How do packages solve the problem?

By separating our services into packages, we effectively categorize them by
stakeholder (thus "Payee").  Services and features that the sanctioning bodies 
are interested in will go into a "state package", funded by the base contract, 
and delivered to their member schools without any additional charge.

This will help to ensure that C2C is delivering upon the promises it is legally
bound to deliver to the sanctioning bodies.

All other features and services will be offered separately, and optionally,
allowing each additional feature and opportunity to be funded and, by extension,
evaluated as either an asset or a liability through ROI calculations.

In the end, C2C will either increase its revenue to a level that allows all of
its features to be sufficiently funded and supported, or it will be able to
eliminate features from its feature set that constantly burden and delay its
ongoing development efforts (thus lowering expenditures).

Either way, the result _should_ be an increase in C2C's net profit.

# Package Structure

C2C will categorize all of its features and services (hereinafter, collectively,
"features") by defining and naming each one (e.g. "Roster Management"). 
"Packages" will provide one or more of those features to each school.

## Package Types

There are two, fundamental, types of packages:

* Feature Packages (a la carte)
* Feature Set Packages (groups)

### Feature Packages

A "feature package" is a package that provides a school with exactly one
feature.  This may also be referred to as "a la carte" packages that allow
schools to pick and pay for only the features that they want to use.

This type of packages intends to service schools that either can not, or will
not, agree to pay for the entire C2C feature offering.

### Feature Sets

A "feature set" is a package that grants more than one feature.  Although
this removes the ability for schools to pick the precise arrangement of features
that they want to use, they will usually come at a discounted rate and allow
schools to get more features for less money.

This type of package intends to service schools that want to use all (or most)
of C2C's total feature offering.  C2C is motivated to encourage this type of
package because it is likely to yield the maximum amount of revenue.  It also
allows schools to explore and use features that they might not have been
convinced to purchase if it had not been included in the set, thereby increasing
C2C's utility and market hold.

## Initial Offerings

At launch, C2C will offer one feature package for each of its features and
exactly **four** feature sets.  Each feature and feature set is listed and
described below:

### C2C's Features

Before we get into the list, its important that we describe what a feature is
and what it is not.

	A "feature", in this context, is any, distinct, part of our software or 
	service that we offer which is not required for its basic, functional, 
	operation.
	    
When evaluating anything to determine if it is, or is not, a bona fied feature
must pass the following tests.  Features must:

it should be considered as incomplete.





The full list of C2C features is provided
and discussed later on in this document, but the initial feature set packages
will be:

* AHSAA State Package
* FHSAA State Package
* MHSAA State Package
* C2C Premium
