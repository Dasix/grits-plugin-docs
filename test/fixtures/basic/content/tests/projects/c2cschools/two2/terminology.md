# Domain Terminology

C2CSchools.com is a very large application that manages a vast and complex spectrum of concepts
for its users and their organizations.

Each user and organization has their own terminology for the things they do, but, over time,
we've tried to establish universal terms, concepts, and abstracts that cover every possible
facet and variation across our user and client base.
 
So, the terms below are our "official terms", compiled over years of painful research and inquiry.
The words herein may go by other names, depending on who you are talking to, and the definitions
provided for those terms may have different meanings when viewed outside the scope of our software.

However, we try very hard to use these terms, _exclusively_, within our documentation and when
communicating internally.  Please try to learn every term that you possibly can, use these terms
when communicating within or about C2C, and do your part in adding to this resource.
