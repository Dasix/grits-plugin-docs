# General Information

Warning: If you are not an employee of C2C Schools, LLC. or one of its subsidiaries, 
you should leave, as this content will neither be useful or interesting to you.
Otherwise we will be forced to dispatch our lawyer-drones in 3... 2...

## You Can (and Should) Help

After you read this page, learn more about this wiki [here](md/tools/devwiki/index.md).

Please, feel free to add to these docs as you see fit.  

> "_Something is always better than nothing._"

> Luke Chavers, CTO and VP

In fact, we insist.  If, while reading this documentation, you see something 
that can be improved; _improve it_.  These docs represent a shared effort to 
help one another learn.  If we rely on a single person's contributions in order 
to improve, we are all going to lose.

Help yourself by helping the team.

## The Sooner, The Better

You have a unique insight when accomplishing something for the first time.  Please
take the time to record your insights into this wiki as you work and learn.  This 
will be integral to the education of any person who follows you.  They, in turn,
should update these docs as they improve each item they work on.  

By the way, did I mention that we pay you to write these?  Don't feel like you 
have to always deal in the shadows of the complexities of programming.  Take some 
time to document what you do.  Thoroughly documenting your progress and improvements
is far more valuable to our company than any actual implementations that exist in
autonomy, unable to be improved upon by the 'next-guy'.

## Golden Rules

Some general statements that almost always apply to everything we do:

1. The only thing acceptable is the best thing imaginable.
2. Don't take the easy road; make the hard road easy.
3. Every project we create should be capable of being updated, immediately, by
simply pushing new source code to the [GitLab](/md/tools/gitlab/index.md) repository.  In other words, you
must configure your projects to automatically test and deploy in response to a
PUSH to the relevant repository.
4. Every project must be designed with the team in mind.  You _must_ consider those 
who will come after you.  If a beginner programmer can't pick up your project and 
run with it, you have failed.
5. Always try to understand "why" something is requested of you.  Until you understand
why something is needed, you won't be valuable in its pursuit.
6. Do the hard work _before_ you ask for help; value the time of others above your 
own and make providing you with help as easy as possible.
7. See: [The Next Guy](/md/conventions/terms.md#The_Next_Guy_-_Your_Actual_Boss).


## Required Reading

Everyone at C2C should read "Getting Real", by 37 Signals.

* [Getting-Real.pdf](/downloads/ebooks/Getting-Real.pdf)
   
Every technical person at C2C should be able to teach the concepts from 
"Web API Design", by ApiGee, to a small child, in a third world country, in
the dark.  While we do not follow _every_ convention outlined, we follow most of
them, and our API is the most important technical detail of our company.
